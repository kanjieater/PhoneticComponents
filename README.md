# Bulk-add Japanese Phonetic Components
![Example](https://i.imgur.com/wrb2Edn.png)

## Overview
This Anki add-on allows you to bulk-add phonetic components from kanji that are already present on your cards. Phonetic components can help you recognize patterns in kanji readings, making learning more efficient.

For more information about phonetic components and their benefits, check out [this article on Tofugu](https://www.tofugu.com/).

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- You must have a field on your card containing kanji readings with furigana, generated by the **Japanese Support** add-on.
  - Example format: `食[た]べる`

### Steps
1. Create a new field on your cards named **Phonetics**. This field will store the phonetic components generated by the add-on.
2. Install the add-on using the code `1362659377` in Anki 2.1:
   - Open Anki
   - Go to `Tools -> Add-ons -> Get Add-ons`
   - Paste in the code `1362659377` and click **OK**
3. Open the add-on configuration window:
   - Set `dstFields` to the name of the field you created (`Phonetics` by default).
   - Set `srcFields` to the field where kanji readings with furigana are stored.
   - Save the configuration.
4. Go to the **Card Browser**, click on **Edit**, and select **Bulk-add Phonetics**.
5. To find cards where a phonetic component was recognized, search for `Phonetics:_*` in the Card Browser.

## Example Behavior
- If your reading field contains `時[とき]`, it will **not** match the phonetic `寺 (じ) → 侍, 持, 時, 塒, 峙`, so nothing will be generated.
- However, if your reading field contains `時間[じかん]`, then `寺 (じ) → 侍, 持, 時, 塒, 峙` will be included.
